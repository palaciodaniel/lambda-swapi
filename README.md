How it works
------------
Simply choose two characters from the *Star Wars* universe, and the program will query *SWAPI* (https://swapi.co/), a *Star Wars* API, to return the movies in which both of them appear.

Important notes
---------------
- The need to input two characters is because I was specifically requested to make the program this way.

- Consider *SWAPI* may be outdated. It mostly covers the original and prequel trilogies, but it only added a small number of elements from *The Force Awakens*, the only movie from the sequel trilogy to be featured.

Running the program
-------------------
Executing the program is pretty easy and straightforward, and it can be done using a *Jupyter Notebook*. The following might seem a lot of instructions, but this is simply because they were written with a lot of precision, in the event someone who isn't a programmer decides to use the program...

01) From this repository, download the file *lambda-swapi.ypinb* to your hard drive. Remember the folder where you put it.

02) Right click on the following URL: https://jupyter.org/try and then select *"Open in a New Tab"*. 

03) Choose the option *"Try Classic Notebook"*.

04) Once the Notebook is loaded, go to *File* > *Open*. A menu in a new tab will appear.

05) On the right part, look for the button *Upload*. Select the file *lambda-swapi.ypinb* you downloaded on Step 1.

06) Now another *Upload* button will appear, the blue one. Press it to upload the file to the Notebook.

07) Once it's uploaded, look for it and click it. It will open on a new tab.

08) Go to *Cell* > *Run All*. 

09) Write your desired character's name and surname, in this order (i.e. "Luke Skywalker" or "Leia Organa"). 

If a character is usually known by their rank, you can also include it in your input (i.e.: "Princess Leia", "Emperor Palpatine", "Count Dooku", "General Grievous").

10) Repeat Step 9 for your second character.

11) Wait until the program returns the movies both characters appear.

12) Once you finish, please go to *Menu* > *Close and Halt*. Then close all the tabs.
